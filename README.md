# Discussion leader assignment for Comp 417/517

In this assignment you will lead discussions and be
responsible for the following three elements:

1. Fill out paper review form
2. Short presentation highlighting key moves and
   contributions of the paper 
3. Facilitating discussion. 
 
## Review Form (25%)

Fill out and commit by midnight the night before: 

[Standard Review Form](./review.md)

Note for most of these sections, concision is preferred.
Provide 1-2 sentences if possible, of course go over if you
need.

## Presentation (25%)

The goal of leading the presentation is to format your
understanding of the paper from the perspective of a
critical reader. It is more an exercise to capture that
you've extracted the critical elements from the paper, as
well as a quick refresher to the class. 

The following slides are expected:

1. Title Page
2. Problem and Motivation
3. Why isn't it solved?
4. The key hypothesis of this paper?
5. The methods used to achieve it (how)?
6. The evaluation results
7. Key takeaways

The presentation should take between 5-12 minutes.

## Discussion Leading (%25)

Develop 5-7 questions after reviewing the online discussion
and lead an initial 15 minute small group and a larger 15
minute discussion.

## Discussion Debrief (%25)

Answer the following questions: 

1. What new insights came out of the discussion?

We talked about what makes a good research paper.
Most students had thought that the main purpose of system security papers is to produce a system that performs better in some metric.
But we also talked about how papers that explain why things work (build theory), illuminate problems in the field, and provide surveys are an important part of research literature.

2. Was there disagreement? Why?

There was definite discussion on how strict adherence to the rules set out in this paper should be.
While most agreed that the high-impact crimes should be avoided, there was discussion on whether or not incomplete papers merit publishing if they propose a novel and innovative new idea.
Some felt that papers should be very thorough and complete and that we should hold the field to the highest standard to produce the best science.
Others felt that complete compliance would be unreasonable as labs have limited resources (such as time, pressure to publish, etc.) and even some of the best implementations and ideas are not complete.

3. What was the consensus about the work?

Overall, most people felt that benchmarking crimes are an issue and that the paper did a good job elucidating them.
Most felt the most strongly about crimes that dealt with the reproducibility of papers, as many students have struggled reproducing other's work when they wanted to build off of it.
There was consensus that papers like this one are important to have published to keep fields honest and progressing forward.
